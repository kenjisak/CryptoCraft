COMP 3109 Applied Cryptography and Authentication Final Project Setup Instructions

If you already have Python 3.10 or later installed, youâ€™ll need to install Python 3.9, 
since 3.10 is currently unsupported by Tink. To determine what version of Python you are using: 
  python3 --version //for Ubuntu

To install Python 3.9 on Ubuntu using APT, run the commands below.
A new binary called python3.9 will be available in your path.
Update your aliases to use this binary instead of the system default python3 or python. 
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa 
  sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-distutils 
  python3.9 -m pip install pynacl tink protobuf==3.20.*

PyNaCl is a Python binding to libsodium, which implements the NaCl library. 
It can be installed directly from PyPi by doing: 
  pip3 install pynacl

The Python implementation of this library (known simply as tink)
can be installed from PyPi (see documentation) by running: 
  pip3 install tink

To run the Application enter the following command:
  python3 CryptoCraftRun.py
